<description>
You are given the following task, plan and implement it in a way that is easy to understand and follow. Use sub-agents where needed.
Use the given task, examples, constraints and test cases to your advantage to ultrathink about how you will solve the task. Also ultrathink of any edge cases and how you will handle them. Keep revving in a loop until you are satisfied with the plan before implementing it. Write the plan into PLAN.md in a way that another LLM can understand and implement it. Your implementation should modify the code in the code block below and write the final code into src/index.ts.

When you have finished, write a short summary into SUMMARY.md of what you did, using what Data Structure, Algorithm or System Design you used to solve the task, and any other relevant information.
